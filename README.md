# AutoMl_Challenge
This is a "supervised learning" challenge in machine learning. We are making available 30 datasets, all pre-formatted in given feature representations (this means that each example consists of a fixed number of numerical coefficients). The challenge is to solve classification and regression problems, without any further human intervention.
